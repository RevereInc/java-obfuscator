# Java Obfuscator

This is a baseline Java obfuscator project designed to apply basic transformations to Java bytecode. The current implementation includes the following obfuscation techniques:

- **String Obfuscation** – Encrypts and disguises string literals.
- **Method Obfuscation** – Renames methods to non-meaningful names.
- **ASCII Obfuscation** – Adds ASCII-based art at the bottom of classes.
- **Field Obfuscation** – Renames fields to obscure their original purpose.

This project serves as a foundation for further development and enhancement of Java obfuscation techniques.
